# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains multiple Computer Vision projects focusing on **object detection, tracking, and vehicle speed estimation** using deep learning and OpenCV. Explore innovative applications like object detection with YOLOv8 and vehicle speed analysis.

## Features
- Object detection projects using deep learning models (e.g., YOLOv8).
- Tracking implementations for counting and vehicle monitoring.
- Vehicle speed estimation with multiple approaches.
- Utilizes OpenCV and deep learning frameworks.
- Well-documented code for learning and adaptation.

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.9+ (tested with 3.11)
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch (depending on project)
- **Hardware**: GPU recommended for deep learning tasks.
